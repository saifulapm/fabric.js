 * Canvas class
 * @class Canvas
 * @extends StaticCanvas
 * @tutorial {@link http://fabricjs.com/fabric-intro-part-1#canvas}
 *
 * @fires object:modified at the end of a transform
 * @fires object:rotating while an object is being rotated from the control
 * @fires object:scaling while an object is being scaled by controls
 * @fires object:moving while an object is being dragged
 * @fires object:skewing while an object is being skewed from the controls
 *
 * @fires before:transform before a transform is is started
 * @fires before:selection:cleared
 * @fires selection:cleared
 * @fires selection:updated
 * @fires selection:created
 *
 * @fires interaction:completed after a drawing operation ends
 * @fires erasing:start
 * @fires erasing:end
 *
 * @fires mouse:down
 * @fires mouse:move
 * @fires mouse:up
 * @fires mouse:down:before  on mouse down, before the inner fabric logic runs
 * @fires mouse:move:before on mouse move, before the inner fabric logic runs
 * @fires mouse:up:before on mouse up, before the inner fabric logic runs
 * @fires mouse:over
 * @fires mouse:out
 * @fires mouse:dblclick whenever a native dbl click event fires on the canvas.
 *
 * @fires dragover
 * @fires dragenter
 * @fires dragleave
 * @fires drag:enter object drag enter
 * @fires drag:leave object drag leave
 * @fires drop:before before drop event. Prepare for the drop event (same native event).
 * @fires drop
 * @fires drop:after after drop event. Run logic on canvas after event has been accepted/declined (same native event).
 * @example
 * let a: fabric.Object, b: fabric.Object;
 * let flag = false;
 * canvas.add(a, b);
 * a.on('drop:before', opt => {
 *  //  we want a to accept the drop even though it's below b in the stack
 *  flag = this.canDrop(opt.e);
 * });
 * b.canDrop = function(e) {
 *  !flag && this.draggableTextDelegate.canDrop(e);
 * }
 * b.on('dragover', opt => b.set('fill', opt.dropTarget === b ? 'pink' : 'black'));
 * a.on('drop', opt => {
 *  opt.e.defaultPrevented  //  drop occurred
 *  opt.didDrop             //  drop occurred on canvas
 *  opt.target              //  drop target
 *  opt.target !== a && a.set('text', 'I lost');
 * });
 * canvas.on('drop:after', opt => {
 *  //  inform user who won
 *  if(!opt.e.defaultPrevented) {
 *    // no winners
 *  }
 *  else if(!opt.didDrop) {
 *    //  my objects didn't win, some other lucky object
 *  }
 *  else {
 *    //  we have a winner it's opt.target!!
 *  }
 * })
 *
 * @fires after:render at the end of the render process, receives the context in the callback
 * @fires before:render at start the render process, receives the context in the callback
 *
 * @fires contextmenu:before
 * @fires contextmenu
 * @example
 * let handler;
 * targets.forEach(target => {
 *   target.on('contextmenu:before', opt => {
 *     //  decide which target should handle the event before canvas hijacks it
 *     if (someCaseHappens && opt.targets.includes(target)) {
 *       handler = target;
 *     }
 *   });
 *   target.on('contextmenu', opt => {
 *     //  do something fantastic
 *   });
 * });
 * canvas.on('contextmenu', opt => {
 *   if (!handler) {
 *     //  no one takes responsibility, it's always left to me
 *     //  let's show them how it's done!
